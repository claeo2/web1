  </p><p style="margin-top:100px;"> Yves Lafon continues as staff contact. Many thanks for contributions to the TAG to the departing participants, David Baron (W3C Invited Expert) and Alice Boxhall (Google), whose terms end at the end of this month. The TAG is a special group within the W3C, chartered under the W3C Process Document, with stewardship of the Web architecture. The mission of the TAG is to build consensus around principles of Web architecture and to interpret and clarify these principles when necessary, to resolve issues involving general Web architecture brought to the TAG, and to help coordinate cross-technology architecture developments inside and outside W3C. The elected Members of the TAG participate as individual contributors, not as representatives of their organizations. TAG participants use their best judgment to find the best solutions for the Web, not just for any particular network, technology, vendor, or user. Learn more about the TAG.</p>
